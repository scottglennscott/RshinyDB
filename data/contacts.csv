SUPERVISION
I am currently joint primary supervisor of a PhD student who is investigating community driven intervention development aimed at reducing alcohol-related injuries and violence among Aboriginal Australians.

CURRENT EMPLOYMENT
National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, Australian National University, ACT, Australia
Research Fellow, 2015  present 
I am currently employed to work on a NHMRC Partnership Project with a focus on investigating inequalities in cardiovascular disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. 

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY
NDARC, UNSW, NSW, Australia
Research Officer, 2007  2015
I project managed a funded project aiming to reduce alcohol-related injuries and violence among Aboriginal people in rural New South Wales through community lead interventions. This involved working with a locally based steering committee to find a balance between rigorous research methods and intervention implementation in a real world setting. I have also worked on a project that tailored and evaluated two evidence-based programs aimed at reducing drug- and alcohol-related harms among Aboriginal Australians in rural NSW. Other research projects I have been involved in are: ACE Alcohol Indigenous study; Alcohol Action in Rural Communities study; the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study; the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort study; and the Cannabis Potency and Contamination study.  My roles have included writing publications and reports, systematic literature searches, data analysis, and leadership through training, supervising and co-ordinating students, research staff and health services staff involved in collaborative research. I was on leave from this role from February 2012 to August 2012, and from January 2014 to January 2015.

Relationships Australia, NSW, Australia
Research Officer, 2008
I worked on a casual basis with researchers to plan an evaluation of an intervention for children who live in high risk households for domestic violence. My main duties were to conduct literature searches and also to work with the team of researchers to develop the study methodology.

A. Personal Statement
I am an internist and an epidemiologist, and have published over 180 peer reviewed articles, as well as dozens of book chapters and a major Brazilian textbook. My works, according to Google Scholar, have been cited 14495 times, and my H-index is 62, Much of my scientific production has been as an investigator of the ARIC Study, with work done both in the United States and in Brazil. My major areas of interest have been diabetes and, secondarily, other cardiovascular risk factors. I trained through medical school and the master´s level in the United States and have, since 1983, worked primarily on research and training aimed at providing an evidence base and competence for improving primary care and for dealing with chronic non-communicable diseases, especially diabetes, in Brazil.

Name:  Brian J. Biroscak, PhD, MS, MA

Topic Areas of Expertise: Brian Biroscak is Assistant Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Yale University. His line of research is focused by a social justice perspective and positioned to make him a leader in violence and injury prevention through knowledge generation, utilization, and dissemination. 
In regard to knowledge generation, Prof. Biroscak has worked in the area of emergency medicine research since November 2008. He considers emergency medicine to be an integral part of public healtha field in which he has extensive experience dating back to the year 2000. Prof. Biroscak contributes to violence and injury prevention through public health-surveillance and -research activities. He also has a strong research interest in system dynamics modeling, which utilizes feedback insights and computer simulation to hypothesize, test, and refine explanations of systems change. 
Prof. Biroscak uses those research insights to guide knowledge utilization efforts for violence and injury prevention, which can reduce the burden of such patients on emergency medicine practitioners as well as contribute to population health improvement. As social improvement ultimately boils down to influencing the behavior of individuals (e.g., violence perpetrators, community members, policymakers), Prof. Biroscaks expertise in social marketing, which integrates commercial marketing with other approaches to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and the greater social good, is particularly valuable. 
Prof. Biroscak shares his lessons learned from research and intervention work through a variety of knowledge dissemination activities. He presents his work in oral and written forms through scientific presentations and publications. He has instructed a number of undergraduate and graduate students. Prof. Biroscak serves on several conference planning committees. As Director of Evaluation for the CDC-funded Florida Prevention Research Center at the University of South Florida, he works to increase the research and development capacity of their faculty and staff. Concurrently, he seeks to do the same as Director of Research for the Section of Research in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Yale University.

III.	WORK AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 

In the last 7 years, I have worked for AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN); APIN was established as a project of the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in 2000 with a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, focusing on HIV prevention including PMTCT in selected states of Nigeria. In 2003, it became a sub- contractor to HSPH on its PEPFAR Track 1.0 grant to provide comprehensive ART services in Nigeria. In 2007, it was incorporated as a legal entity in Nigeria and has since been implementing comprehensive HIV care and treatment programmes with funding from PEPFAR through the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Nigeria and the Global Fund. Cumulatively, APIN has provided care and treatment services to about  150,000 HIV infected children and adults in over 100 health facilities across 13 states of Nigeria and it implements one of the most robust electronic patient record management system for HIV care in Nigeria.

	January 2014 till date:

Senior Technical Advisor, Quality Assurance and Quality Improvement
AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN)
I am responsible for the design of clinical and programme Quality Management (QM) policies and systems. I also contribute to clinical and programme management policy development APIN wide based on findings from quality management reports and site supervisory visits. I also represent my organization on the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) led national Quality Improvement (QI) task team which is responsible for developing a national HIV QI strategy and spreading the QI culture in Nigeria. I am also responsible for designing and implementing QI trainings at the programme office and supported clinics based on training needs assessments and I work with the Plateau State Ministry of Health HIV QI management team to build their capacity to lead state wide HIV QI activities.

I also coordinate the organizations research efforts by supporting proposal development, linking programme officers to available resources and people with similar interests and liaising with external collaborators. My most important current research activity is summarised below:

Title of research project:  Patient and health system factors associated with Loss To Follow Up (LTFU) and unplanned care interruption in HIV care.
Role on project: In- country team lead
Project description:  This 5 year study (January 2013- December 2017) funded by NIH is a K23 career development grant awarded to Dr Aimalohi Ahonkhai of Massachusetts General Hospital Boston. The project aims to study the four domains of health system processes that might affect patient adherence with chronic HIV care: accessibility, affordability, acceptability, and availability. It is also examining decisional conflict at the patient level and its association with LTFU and care interruption and will use the findings to pilot a home-based HIV care intervention (or any other intervention supported by data from early phases of the study) designed to address important health system processes and sources of patient conflict to reduce LTFU and unplanned care interruption.
Responsibilities on the team:
o	Liaison between the study team and ethical review boards of study clinics and corresponding author on prospective study. I also monitor compliance with ethical standards during data abstraction, patient enrollment and follow up 
o	Liaison between study team and in-country grants and finance departments
o	Programmatic advise during proposal development 
o	Mapping of available programme data and data sources to study questions
o	Contribute to abstract/manuscript writing

	September 2011- December 2013
Senior Programme Specialist, Strategic Information (SI), APIN

I coordinated the activities of the SI department consisting of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), database management and quality assurance units; ensuring that the department provided APIN with evidence for driving programming including clinical patient care, laboratory services and financial management and supported partner HIV treatment sites to set up and maintain systems for electronic data capture, reporting and data use. As part of the organizations health systems strengthening activities, I managed the process that supported 3 states to conduct their first ever M&E systems assessment using the UNAIDS 12 component tool.  I also led the team that carried out the grant close out activities for the organizations first five year PEPFAR grant 


	May 2009  August  2011
Quality Assurance Coordinator (APIN)

I set up the organizations quality assurance unit and my major responsibility was to drive quality improvement programmes with a view to achieve best practice performance levels and implementation of evidence based practices in caring for HIV infected patients and their families at supported HIV clinics. I achieved this by developing a quality assurance strategy for the organization and supporting all clinical sites to establish site led QI Committees. I also developed and implemented a QI coaching framework for over 40 clinical sites supported by APIN. 

	February 2007 to April 2009
 Monitoring and Evaluation Coordinator, APIN

My major responsibility was to strengthen routine M&E systems in the programme office and at supported HIV clinics. I achieved this by developing M&E guidelines as a strategy for improving the quality of the data available for patient management and programme reporting. I also developed the programmes first data quality audit protocol, and gained extensive experience of conducting data quality audits at service delivery points. I represented APIN on the national HIV QI pilot project implemented by PEPFAR, FMOH and HIVQual New York and developed a successful proposal to establish a quality assurance unit separate from M&E in the organization.

In 1974 I was admitted as a teacher of anatomy and physiology at the Instituto de Ciencias Médicas in Maputo and the following year I was appointed has director of the same Institute. In 1977, working in another city of Mozambique. I was also the director of the local Institute for paramedical training. In 1981 I start teaching in the faculty of medicine of the Eduardo Mondlane University where I am still working now as associated professor of Medicine. From 1990 to 1992 I was appointed has the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. Also since 1989 I have been involved in the training of future specialists of internal medicine, pediatrics, anesthesiology and intensive care. 
The second area of activity is research. My main area of interest is epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors in Mozambique and its evolution throughout the time. I have done a national survey using the WHO STEPWISE methodology to evaluate the prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in Mozambique in 2005 and I repeated it in the end of 2014. I am also involved with several other teams in Africa and also in Europe, United states and Canada.

I started my research work with the subject of my PhD thesis about hypertension, salt sensitivity and the renal dopaminergic system. It took me three years studding hypertensive patients and normotensive subjects and feeding them with a standard diet for a two weeks with the only difference of the salt content in each week and looking for the results in terms of 24 hours ambulatory BP and excretion of dopamine metabolites.  I have published a few papers:

a.	Acute hypotensive, natriuretic, and hormonal effects of nifedipine in salt-sensitive and salt-resistant black normotensive and hypertensive subjects. A Damasceno, Alejandro Santos, Manuel Pestana, et al. J Cardiov Pharmacol 1999; 34: (3): 346-353
b.	Deficiency of renal dopaminergic-dependent natriuretic response to acute sodium load in black salt-sensitive subjects in contrast to salt-resistants. A Damasceno, Alejandro Santos, Paula Serrão, et al. J Hypertens 1999 Dec;17(12 Pt 2):1995-2001.
c.	Influence of salt intake on the daytime-nighttime blood pressure variation in black normotensive and hypertensive subjects. A Damasceno, Paula Caupers, Alejandro Santos, et al. Rev Port Cardiol 2000; Mar;19(3):315-29
d.	Renal dopaminergic mechanisms in renal parenchymal diseases, hypertension, and heart failure. Soares-da-Silva P, Pestana M, Ferreira A, Damasceno A,et al. Clin Exp Hypertens 2000 Apr;22(3):251-68.

The second phase of my research was the result of a national survey with a representative sample of 3323 subjects with ages between 25 and 64 years looking for the prevalence of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The analysis of the data was done in collaboration with the Department of Public Health of the Oporto University. This result also in a  few publications.

a)	Hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in Mozambique: urban/rural gap during epidemiological transition. Damasceno A, Azevedo A, Silva-Matos C et al. Hypertension. 2009 Jul;54(1):77-83. 
b)	Body mass index and waist circumference in Mozambique: urban/rural gap during epidemiological transition. Gomes A, Damasceno A, Azevedo A et al N. Obes Rev. 2010 Apr 7.

d)	Physical activity patterns in Mozambique: Urban/rural differences during epidemiological transition. Padrão P, Damasceno A, Silva-Matos C et al Prev Med. 2012 Aug 23.
Finally in the third phase the results of multiple collaborative studies with African partners and with the team from the Macmaster University come out.

My life, education and work in diverse international settings have enriched my awareness of global health issues preparing me for a research-centered profession. As a doctoral student I am working to expand my knowledge of psychological and social determinants of health and get advanced training in research design, robust methodological skills, which will equip me to take up more challenging research work independently.                                                                                                                                                                                               Current Position: Predoctoral Fellow University of California, San Diego Center on Gender Equity and Health 9500 Gilman Drive #0507 Division of Global Public Health La Jolla, CA 92093 Department of Medicine a2dixit@ucsd.edu                                                                                                                                                                                            Education: PhD, Public Health (Global Health), Currently pursuing University of California San Diego / San Diego State University Joint Doctoral Program in Public Health (Global Health track) MSc, Health Psychology, 2012 University of Sussex, UK BSc, Psychology with Sociology, 2010 University of Sussex, UK                                                                                                                                                                                            Employment 2016-present Predoctoral Fellow, Center on Gender Equity and Health, University of California, San Diego 2015-2016 Program Officer, Population Council, India 2013-2015 Assistant Program Officer, Population Council, India 2011-2013 Consultant, Population Council, India 2011 Intern, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), India 2009 UNICEF, Kenya 2009 Kivuli Center, Koinonia International, Kenya                                                                                                                                                                                               Peer-Reviewed Publications 1.

An approach that situates the individual risk factors and their interaction within a context that determines health outcomes has been the underlying basis of my research. I am one of the Principal Investigator’s of the Mater-University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) cohort. Over the past 12 years, I have been leading the cardiovascular and respiratory epidemiology research in the MUSP that included 30 years follow-up of the MUSP offspring cohort (Gen 2) and the first follow-up of the children-of-the-offspring cohort (Gen 3). In recent years, I have expanded my research in the low & middle income countries focusing on the rapid socio-economic development, environmental change and the demographic and epidemiological transitions. I have made significant contributions to understand the itical stages of life and early life determinants of cardiovascular and respiratory health. From the life course perspective, some of my papers are influential while thinking about the early development of health and well-being. For instance, my research confirmed that parents, especially mothers, are the role model for offspring health and well-being development from early life to adolescence and then to young adulthood. My research shows that weight management and prevention of obesity should start as early as possible even before or during pregnancy. I am interested to contribute new knowledge about the extent that socioeconomic, family and environmental factors track from generation to generation and how this impacts on health and well-being of the future generations.","","","","Primary_Address","","","","","0","","","Brisbane","PhD","","IHME received author form","0","PhD","","IHME received author form","","","","","","0","","","yes","The University of Queensland","4053","","Student","","","0","0","","","","A","","0","Australia,Bangladesh,India,Indonesia,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Individual","","Queensland","","","","Colleague","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","",""

Platelet- Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) Trial   
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. An ischemic stroke is a cerebral infarction. In POINT, eligibility is limited to brain TIAs and to minor ischemic strokes (with an NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score less than or equal to 3).

Rivaroxaban versus Aspirin in Secondary Prevention of Stroke and Prevention of Systemic Embolism in Patients with Recent Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS) (NAVIGATE ESUS)
This is a study in patients who recently had a brain attack (stroke) and in whom no clear cause of the stroke could be identified. These strokes are likely due to a blood clot and therefore, can be called embolic stroke of undetermined source. The abbreviation is ESUS. The study will compare 2 blood thinners. Patients will be randomly assigned to either Rivaroxaban 15 mg or Aspirin 100 mg and the study is intended to show, if patients given rivaroxaban have fewer blood clots in the brain (stroke) or in other blood vessels.

A. Personal Statement. 
After a MD training from the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaoundé 1 (Cameroon), Dr. Wonkam completed a thesis in Cell Biology in the Department of Morphology, University of Geneva (Switzerland). On a transgenic mice model, he evidenced that ectopic expression of Connexin32 leads to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of pancreatic insulin producing beta cells. He was awarded the 2003 Denber-Pinard prize for the best thesis from the Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva. 
Other salient aspects of Dr. Wonkams background include his education as a medical geneticist at a highly reputable genetics department in Geneva. He subsequently practices medical genetics in both European and African contexts. Dr. Wonkams interests are reflected in more than 70 peer-reviewed publications, which are in laboratory, clinical, educations and ethical aspects of medical genetics. 
He was recently awarded for 2014, the very competitive UK Clinical Genetics International Fellowship from the British Society of Genetics Medicine.  Dr Wonkam is secretary of the African Society of Human Genetics, board member of Southern African Society of Human Genetics and the International Federation of Human Genetics Societies, member of the HUGO council.
Dr. Wonkam has a proven record on Hearing loss research among Africans. Specifically his research group has convincingly shown that Mutations in GJB2, GJB6 and GJA1 are not a major cause of non-syndromic deafness in Africans and should not be routinely investigated in clinical practice. Subsequently, he has investigated 10 Cameroonian families with autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss, using a massively parallel targeted sequencing platform: the OtoSCOPE® which incorporates 66 hearing loss genes. Causative mutations were identified in 7 families (77.8%): in MYO7A in two families and the following genes were involved in the rest: CDH23, LOXHD1, SLC26A4A, OTOF, and STRC. Twelve mutations were novel and secondary findings of variants of unknown significance were reported for 7 of the 9 families. Potentially exploring 3/10 of these families where mutations were not found, using Whole Exome sequencing could lead to new genes discovery. Jointly with Dr Leal, Dr Wonkam has the expertise and field experience to conduct the project proposed here to full success.

C.	Contribution to Science

Genetic of hearing loss in Africa 
Dr. Wonkam has a proven record on Hearing loss research among African (1). Specifically His research group has convincingly shown that Mutations in GJB2, GJB6 and GJA1 are not a major cause of non-syndromic deafness in Africans and should not be routinely investigated in clinical practice (2-5). Subsequently, he has investigated 10 Cameroonian families with autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss, using a massively parallel targeted sequencing platform: the OtoSCOPE® which incorporates 66 hearing loss genes. Causative mutations were identified in 7 families (77.8%): in MYO7A in two families and the following genes were involved in the rest: CDH23, LOXHD1, SLC26A4A, OTOF, and STRC. Twelve mutations were novel and secondary findings of variants of unknown significance were reported for 7 of the 9 families (unpublished data). Whole Exome Sequencing of two of the 3 families that did not shown any mutation on the OtoSCOPE® panel has led to the discovery on a new gene of hearing loss (unpublished data).  The proof of concept that the use of WES in ARNHL among African families, could not only have major implication in practice for global African populations, but could lead to new genes discovery.

Sickle cell Disease: genetic and public health intervention
Dr. Wonkam has a proven record on sickle disease research in Africa oriented in the used of genetics to address public health intervention. He has introduced the practice of prenatal genetic diagnosis of SCD in both Cameroon (1) and Cape Town. He has tractable record of studying psychosocial burden of SCD and genomic factors that affect the SCD phenotype, specifically HbF-promoting loci (2) and co-inheritance of SCD and alpha-thalassemia in Cameroon (3-4).  He is PI of an NIH funded  H3Africa grant aiming to examine ethical issues relating to sickle cell genomics research in Cameroon, Tanzania and Ghana (http://www.h3africa.org/consortium/projects).

Capacity building and Genetic Education
Seminal work of Dr Wonkam have evidence the major need to increase genetic knowledge at all the levels of medical education in Africa  (1), through capacity building and the development of effective genetic services (2).  He subsequently invests in medical genetic research and report on an effective framework to increase capacity in human and medical genetics in Africa (3-4).

Medical / research ethics in genetics
Dr Wonkam have reported intensively on the majors challenges on ethics of medical abortion in genetic medicine practice in Africa: a call for policy action in sub-Saharan Africa to rethink diagnostics for pregnancy affected by  e.g. sickle cell disease: differential views of medical doctors, parents and adult patients predicted value conflicts (1-3). He subsequently extended his work of the others filed of research ethic including the challenges of the uses of genetics for gender testing in sport (4) that have great contributed to the policy of the International Federation.  Dr Wonkam through his work is also a strong advocate, in changing research ethics practice in Africa, that have offer failed to failed to follow the basic principles and the need to engage the communities .

Research
My areas of research expertise include issues surrounding transcultural care, particularly of the elderly. 
I have worked in a series of international research collaborations with, among others, the University of California, San Francisco; University of Sheffield, U.K.; Universidad de Chile, Chile; and the University of Alberta, Canada. I have also initiated development of a joint Ph.D. program involving the Karolinska Institutet, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (Sweden) and the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Iran Medical University, and the Medical University of Isfahan, Iran. I served as the director of this successful international joint doctoral program. 
To date, I have more than 70 publications including articles in refereed international and Swedish journals, three book chapters and two scientific reports. I have been awarded more than $6 million in grants and endowments to support my research and that of my doctoral students. I serve on the editorial boards and/or as a reviewer for six peer-reviewed journals. I have been chairwoman of seven national and international committees, in addition to serving on a number of evaluation committees for national and international grants in Sweden, e.g. Vice Chair of the Karolinska University Hospital Committee for Research and Education (FoUU).

05/14  12/14   MedStar Franklin Square Medical Center, Baltimore MD	
                             Clinical Externship

I worked as an extern with Dr. Naeem Lughmani to his rounds at the 2T ICU department at Franklin Square Medical Center.  I participated in the morning report set up by the doctors and the nursing staff, and also went over the previously ordered lab works.  I accompanied Dr. Lughmani to his rounds with the patients where we discussed the ongoing patient progress and devised a better future treatment plan for the patients.  I came across different and difficult scenarios and learned how to manage them effectively. This experience provided me an insight on how to tackle those patients who were not in critical condition but at the same not ready to be sent to the wards.  During this time I learned team management and workmanship with the hospital staff.

This experience provided me an opportunity to further enhance my knowledge in medicine by learning new techniques and research.  I was exposed to a broad spectrum of ICU and CCU patients.  I also gained experience in entering and managing patient data using their electronic medical record system.  Overall, this experience greatly augmented my clinical knowledge and practical experience.

                             Clinical Externship

I have worked with Dr. Naeem Lughmani M.D. at the Sleep Medicine Clinic located in Towson, MD.  I attended and actively engaged in physicians history taking and patient diagnosis sessions.  I also spent time with the physician in interpreting patients sleep study and CPAP results to help provide the patient with best possible and effective therapy.  This provided me with an opportunity to further develop a good doctor patient relationship and also helped me learn ways to effectively deal with patients from a diverse cultural and socio-economic background. I was able to go through polysomnography results with Dr. Lughmani and deduced the best possible treatment plans for the patients.

Volunteer Work:

Humanity First, USA- Medical Volunteer (August, 2014)

Humanity Firsts mission is to serve disaster struck and socially disadvantaged individuals and families in the poorer communities of the world. They aim to:
	Relieve suffering caused by natural disasters and human conflicts
	Promote peace and understanding based on mutual tolerance and respect
	Strengthen peoples capacity to help themselves.

With a team of 20 volunteers that included; two general physicians (including myself), 15 medical students, 1 dentist, 1 dental hygienist and a few administrative support staff, we visited Antigua, Guatemala for a week in August 2014 to provide our free health expertise to the poor community there. We treated almost 3000 patients in a span of one week. We provided free health checkups along with free medicine through the Humanity First pharmacy that was setup in each campsite. The idea was to identify most common illnesses and provide most efficient quickest relief as possible. The plan on large was to educate people about self-hygiene as well make them aware about self-health. 
More information about Humanity First and its mission can be found on their Website at http://usa.humanityfirst.org/index.php

          Community Medicine Volunteer Project (2004):
           
This project was to educate women living in rural areas of Pakistan to practice safe contraceptive methods and help them plan their family effectively.  This project was conducted by the Community Medicine Department during 3rd year of Medical school. We reached out to women who had little or no access to health providers. As I believe that a healthier nation can only be produced if mothers of that nation are educated and are provided with a healthy lifestyle.

In addition, his seminal work in diabetic foot including development of indigenous off-loading system and revascularization procedures in patients with diabetes has helped in preventing the amputation in many of them.  He was first to coin the term diabetic hand describing changes in the hands of patients with diabetes and now this has become a part of curriculum in medicine. He was instrumental in establishing the modalities to assess the insulin sensitivity in obese and T2DM patients (clamp studies), first of its kind in India.  This has enabled to understand the pathogenesis of diabetes.  

In addition to diabetes, his other areas of interest include pituitary and adrenal disorders.  His work in this area has garnered him to receive ICMR award for Pituitary Disorders. 

He has published 317 articles in indexed, peer-reviewed, high impact factors journals in the field of Diabetes and Endocrinology.

The patients are catered not only from the neighbouring states, but also from Uttrakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Eastern UP and Western Rajasthan, thereby serving almost 9 states of the country.
 
He has passion for teaching and has conducted more than 250 Continuing Medical Education Programmes (CMEs) across the country, to educate and update the doctors in the field of Diabetes, Thyroid disorders and Osteoporosis.  His narrative abilities has helped him to  strike a chord with the audience and marked him as one of the best speaker in medical fraternity.

	In addition to it, he launched a School Health Programme sensitizing and educating the children and adolescents of urban and rural Chandigarh regarding their life style, dietary habits  and prevention of overweight and obesity in these children.  A total of 10,000 students were covered under this programme and educative lectures were deliberated to these children regarding their life style and dietary habits.  

Besides this, he has organized several Diabetes Camps for assessing the prevalence of diabetes in the area of Punjab and Chandigarh under the auspices of Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR), (ICMR-INDIAB Study),  which has helped to estimate the magnitude of the disease and educating the people for prevention of diabetes. He is the founder Chairman of Association of Diabetes in young in Tricity (ADITI) and actively helping the children with diabetes in their management.

(d) Synergistic Activities

1. NASA Health and Air Quality: Dr. Akanda is a co-PI in NASA Project A Multi-sensor Remote Sensing Approach to Predict Cholera (NNX15AF71G) where he is focused on developing a cholera and water related diarrheal disease forecasting system in Bangladesh based on hydroclimatic determinants of endemic, epidemic, and mixed-mode cholera transmission and spatiotemporal patterns of population vulnerability in coastal and inland areas.

2. NSF IGERT: Dr. Akanda was a contributor in the conceptualization and preparation of the NSF funded IGERT project titled Water Across Boundaries: Integrating Science, Engineering, Policy and Governance to Resolve World Water Conflicts (0966093). Dr Akanda contributed as an early contributor to the project in the preparation of the proposal and the website AquaPedia, as well as for presentation at the World Water Forum 2009 in Istanbul, Turkey.

3. NIH RC1: Dr. Akanda was active contributor and researcher in the preparation, submission, and execution of the NIH funded challenge grant research project in Effects of Climate Change on Cholera Dynamics and Prediction (1RC1-TW008587-01) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009. Dr. Akanda was a primary author of the research proposal, and also worked in the project after funding as graduate research assistant and as project consultant.

4. NIH T90: Dr. Akandas doctoral research was supported two years by the NIH Ruth Kirschtein Predoctoral Fellowship for the proposal titled Remote Sensing Detection of Cholera (1T90-DK070117-05). Dr. Akanda carried out his doctoral work on the relationships on large-scale hydroclimatology and cholera outbreaks in the Bengal Delta region, one of the biggest cholera endemic regions using large-scale climate and satellite remote sensing datasets. His doctoral work was the first to identify that the two unique seasonal cholera peaks seen in the Bengal Delta region is influenced by distinct seasonal, spring and fall, hydroclimatic processes.","","","","Primary_Address","","","","","0","","","Kingston","PhD","","","0","MS, PhD, BTech","","","","","","","","0","","","yes","University of Rhode Island","2881","","","","","0","0","","","","Shafqat","","0","Bangladesh,India,Indonesia,Mozambique,Nigeria,Pakistan,Puerto Rico","1 Lippitt Road, Bliss Hall 302",",Unsafe water source,Unsafe sanitation,","","","","","","2015","","","","","","","","14425834","Expert confirmation and welcome mail sent,Timeline update 1,Preliminary CoD estimates for review","","","","","","","","Individual","","Rhode Island","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02SEMW","","","","","Fast track","","0","","","","","","","","","","",""

REDE INTERAGENCIAL DE INFORMAÇÕES PARA A SAÚDE
Descrição: A Iniciativa Regional de Dados Básicos em Saúde tem por objetivo apoiar esforços dos países membros em reunir dados e informações para caracterizar a situação de saúde no continente, bem como tornar esses dados disponíveis ao público em geral. Sua concepção baseia-se na seleção de um conjunto de indicadores, agrupados por categorias, que permite traçar um panorama geral da situação de saúde na Região. O trabalho empreendido tem motivado as esferas nacionais a aperfeiçoar seus sistemas e bases de dados e a produzir e divulgar informações, segundo critérios comuns. Ainda em 1995, o Ministério da Saúde e a Representação da OPAS no Brasil acordaram em cooperar no aperfeiçoamento de informações para a saúde, em alinhamento com a Iniciativa Regional de Dados Básicos em Saúde. Uma avaliação preliminar das experiências realizadas em passado recente indicou, como prioridade estratégica, o estabelecimento de ação interinstitucional capaz de potencializar os recursos disponíveis, e de aperfeiçoar a capacidade de formulação, coordenação, gestão e operacionalização do sistema nacional de informações em saúde, preconizado na Lei Orgânica do SUS. A estratégia proposta baseou-se na criação da Rede Interagencial de Informações para a Saúde (Ripsa), concebida por grupo de trabalho ad hoc no qual estiveram representadas as principais estruturas do Ministério da Saúde, a Opas e instituições-chave da política de informações em saúde no País (IBGE, Abrasco, Faculdade de Saúde Pública da USP e Ipea). O Secretário-Executivo do Ministério coordenou o grupo, com o apoio de um secretariado técnico. A Rede deveria articular entidades representativas dos segmentos técnicos e científicos nacionais envolvidos na produção, análise e disseminação de dados, viabilizando parcerias capazes de propiciar informações úteis ao conhecimento e à compreensão da realidade sanitária brasileira e de suas tendências. Em oficinas de trabalho seguintes, foram definidos os objetivos e estrutura da Rede, a matriz de indicadores, os produtos prioritários e a integração de outras instituições de importância nacional para o sistema de informações.

Achievements
I have extensive experience in the analysis of data from large healthcare databases, administrative databases and health surveys; dealing with record linkage and methodological issues in the analysis of linked data; and ethical and governance issues in the use of data from electronic health records. I have used this expertise to develop programmes of research in health system performance; health inequalities; organisation & delivery of health services; quality improvement in the management of long-term illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disorders; and the evaluation of new technology and new policy interventions in healthcare.  I have published extensively from my work using data from electronic health records. One example of my applied public health research is work undertaken to improve chronic disease programmes in primary care is the Cutting Out Needless Deaths Using IT (CONDUIT) programme. This programme established electronic registers for cardiovascular disease (BMJ 2000;321:548-50) and diabetes (BMJ 2003;326:1130) in London, and led to major improvements in the organisation of services for these disorders in primary care. These developments have led to significant improvements in chronic disease management, particularly for patients from poorer socio-economic groups and from ethnic minorities, thus helping to address long-standing inequalities in access to healthcare (CMAJ 2007;176:1705-10, PLoS Medicine 2007;12:;e191, Diabetes Care 2011;34: 655-657). This work subsequently led to the development of an information-based comprehensive quality improvement programme for primary care (BMJ 2011;342:c7085). In policy work for national bodies, I have carried our reviews on the secondary uses of primary care data for both the Department of Health (2002) and Association of Public Health Observatories (2005); and an evaluation of the National Congenital Surveillance System for the ONS (Arch Dis Child 2005; 90: F368-73). At the ONS, I also developed systems for monitoring deaths in areas such as dementias and neurodegenerative disorders (BMJ 1998; 317:320-321) and drug poisoning & overdose (PLoS Medicine 2007;4:e105).
